# sequence-finder
This was an assigned coding project for a summer opportunity. The assignment is in two parts:

Part 1 is as follows:

Your program will receive 2 sequences of digits (0-9) in the file ​input.txt​. The
program has to find the longest contiguous subpart consisting of identical digits that is present in both sequences and write it to a file called output.txt.
For example, if input.txt contains:

  1123222345
  35666532234222

output.txt should contain

  222

Note that the input sequences could be extremely long, requiring you to write an efficient program.

Part 2 is as follows:

Your program will receive 2 sequences of digits (0-9) in the file input.txt. 
The program has to find the longest contiguous subpart that is present in both sequences and write it to a file called output.txt.
For example, if input.txt contains:

1123222345
35666532234222

output.txt should contain

2234

Note that the input sequences could be extremely long, requiring you to write an efficient program.
